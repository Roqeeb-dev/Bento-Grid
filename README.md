## Overview

This is a bento grid layout of a webpage built using HTML. Tailwind CSS, CSS Grid, Flexbox.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

## My process

I first constructed the mobile view as Tailwind CSS uses a mobile first workflow and then i added extra styles to optimize it for Desktop view as per the requiremets of the challenge.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to use "overflow:hidden" to hide the part of a div that extends beyond the allocated space. I also understand grid templates better now. 

### Continued development

To a senior software developer and probably myself in few years' time, my code is rubbish as i know i took non-standard measures to achieve this layout. Hence why i need to and will continue learning CSS Grid to master it indepth and construct more complex layouts.

### Useful resources

Same as always: ChatGPT and w3schools.
